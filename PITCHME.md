#UI AND UX
*"UX is focused on the user’s journey to solve a problem, UI is focused on how a product’s surfaces look and function"*
#HSLIDE
##Apparent Strengths / Weaknesses
#VSLIDE
###What we're good at
- Involving the user in the design |
- Producing nice looking interfaces |
- Producing responsive interfaces |
- Keeping interfaces simple, consistent |
- Information architecture - well structured, labelled, and organised content |
#VSLIDE
###What we're bad at:
- Making low-effort mock ups and wireframes of the solution |
- Mapping out the whole workflow before it is built |
- Larger scale testing before release |
- Designing with accessibility in mind |
- Entering the design process with a set of requirements |
- Using analytics to understand existing sites |
- Observing the site's real-world use |

##UI <span style="font-size:40px">vs</span> UX
- **User Interface (UI)** the series of screens, pages and visual elements
- **User Experience (UX)** the internal experience that a person has as they interact with every aspect of a company’s products and services.
#VSLIDE
##Why is UI/UX important
- Reduce errors |
- Reduce time taken on tasks |
- Easier to sell |
- Retain customers |

##General UI Principles

#VSLIDE
###Motion
Motion shows how an app is organised and what it can do.
#VSLIDE
###Motion provides
- Guided focus between views |
- Hints at what will happen if a user completes a gesture |
- Hierarchical and spatial relationships between elements |
- Distraction from what’s happening behind the scenes (like fetching content or loading the next view) |
- Character, polish, and delight |
#VSLIDE
###Responsive motion
- Full of energy
- Respond quickly to user input
#VSLIDE
###Natural motion
- Take inspiration from real world
- For example when you press a button it moves in the direction you press
- In the real world objects smoothly speed up/down
#VSLIDE
###Consistent movement
- If a new element slides if from the left, it should be removed by sliding it out to the right
- If you do the above for one element it should be consistent around the site

#VSLIDE
###Colour
- Colour contrast costs mental energy to process 
- Lots of contrasting colours looks chaotic and will make it hard to use/understand
- Similar to background = unimportant, can be ignored, maybe even locked/disabled (the extreme example is a greyed out button)
- Different from background = important, attracts attention
#VSLIDE
###What does a colour mean? 
- <span style="color:red">Red</span> = warning
- <span style="color:green">Green</span> = safe
- <span style="color:blue">Blue</span> = neutral, trust
- <span style="color:yellow">Yellow</span> = less severe version of red
#VSLIDE
But this changes depending on the overall interface colour.

Consistent hues are very typical: eg facebook, twitch, etc. Keeps an interface easy to use over periods of time
For overall feel, Black = edgy, white = simple, blue = neutral, trust, etc etc

#VSLIDE
###Consistency
- Consistency builds trust |
- Inconsistency builds mistrust and feels unprofessional |
- Consistency makes learning easier |
- Reduce errors. For example if you swap cancel and confirm buttons in one place you can cause CHAOS|

#VSLIDE
###Size

<span style="font-size:60px">Large things are important</span>

<span style="font-size:20px">Smaller things less so</span>

#VSLIDE
###Density
Each addition to the UI decreases the relative importance of everything else on the UI
Each addition also gives the user less time to understand the other features
The optimal interface has the minimum things on the screen at one time

#VSLIDE
###Position
- Centre = important
- Periphery = less important

#VSLIDE
###Offscreen
Moving something offscreen is like a more pronounced version of putting it on the periphery in terms of importance.
Things should only be offscreen if they are only situationally useful, but can normally be ignored.
Anything that is needed regularly should be on the screen all the time.
If you can't fit it on the screen and it's still important enough to be on there, your interface is too cluttered and the design must be simplified.

#VSLIDE
###Responsive UI vs Reponse time
- Click > wait 3 mins > response = not response, slow response time
- Click > progress bar > 3 min wait while it finishes > response = responsive but slow

#VSLIDE
###Accessibility
- What if you were colour-blind?
- What if you can't use a mouse?
- We are required by law to make *'reasonable adjustments'* to provide disabled access to our software! https://www.out-law.com/page-330

#VSLIDE
###HOWEVER
Always consider the user. Look at VS when you're debugging. you have: the code, the call stack, the variable, maybe threads etc etc. 

Programmers, like some other types of users, are generally happier with complex screens with high information density.

#HSLIDE
##General UX Principles
- Must meet the needs of the user |
- Simplicity and elegance "A joy to own, a joy to use" |
#VSLIDE
"True user experience goes far beyond giving customers what they say they want, or providing checklist features. In order to achieve high-quality user experience in a company’s offerings there must be a seamless merging of the services of multiple disciplines, including engineering, marketing, graphical and industrial design, and interface design."
#VSLIDE
## Key UX Elements
- The process they go through to discover your company’s product
- The sequence of actions they take as they interact the interface
- The thoughts and feelings that arise as they try to accomplish their task
- The impressions they take away from the interaction as a whole
#VSLIDE
###Workflow
Ensure the user knows where they are in a process. 
Next > next > next > next > finish is frustrating from step 2 onwards if you dont know how many more clicks you have.

#VSLIDE
###Cognitive workload
How much mental work it is to navigate/interact with a UI. Ideal is none.
As above, signal to noise ratio. Stuff that is irrelevant stays off screen.
#VSLIDE
## UX is difficult to expain 
- Look how much we have on UI vs UX in this presentation

#HSLIDE
##Rough process:
- Get the requirements 
- Translate the requirements by expressing the user's workflow in some way (eg flow chart, user stories) 
- Ensure that is correct by involving the users to some extent 
#VSLIDE
##Rough process:
- What needs to be on the screen? What is more or less important? Think about position & size 
- Build simple mockups and wireframes, and screen flow diagrams. Working on paper or software (eg pencil) doesn't matter 
- Check with users. Repeat this and previous step until we have the optimal solution 
#VSLIDE
##Rough process:
- Think about colour, responsiveness 
- Begin build
